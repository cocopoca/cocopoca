<p>The chart presents the different purposes for which students at a certain university use their phones for reading. According to the chart, the percentages indicate their preferences. The most popular purpose is learning knowledge, chosen by 59.5% of respondents. This is followed by killing time at 21.3%, and getting information comes next at 17.0%. The “other” category has the lowest percentage at 2.2%.</p>
<p>The above percentages reflect residents’ tendency to exercise alone. We can attribute this phenomenon to the following aspects. In begin with, compared to exercising with others, exercising alone offers greater flexibility and freedom, leading residents to prefer exercising alone. What’s more,with the rapid development of science and technology, <code>mobile phones are accessible, and cell-phone reading enjoys great popularity among university students</code>.there are now more tools available to help us create personalized exercise plans, making solo workouts more efficient. Additionally, another significant portion of people choose to exercise with friends, which may be because having company allows for mutual supervision without the chaos that can come with group exercises.</p>
<p>To sum up, we can predict that this trend will continue in  the future, because it conforms to the characteristics of <code>modem university students</code> and our times.（Based on the above reasons, we can draw the conclusion  that an increasing number of people are willing to exercise alone  and the trend may continue in the future. Certainly, no matter  which way of exercise you choose, it’s the action that counts・）</p>

<p>The bar chart presents the comparison between the <code>employment status</code> of <code>undergraduate graduates</code> from a certain university in 2013 and 2018（from 2013 to 2018）. (It shows three categories: employment, further education, and entrepreneurship.) In 2013, the majority of graduates chose to enter the job market directly, accounting for 68.1%. In contrast, only 26.3% opted for further education, while a mere 1.3% decided to start their own businesses. By 2018, however, the situation had changed noticeably. The proportion of graduates who went straight into employment dropped to 60.7%, whereas those pursuing higher education increased significantly to 34.0%. Interestingly, the number of graduates choosing to embark on entrepreneurial ventures also rose slightly to 2.6%.</p>
<p>We can attribute this phenomenon to the following aspects. To begin with,the drop&#x2F;rise in the proportion of employment appears  probably because college students are confronted with great job  hunting pressure.</p>

<p>The bar chart illustrates the changes in China’s express delivery volume from 2018 to 2020, comparing the total volume and rural volume separately. Over the three-year period, the <code>total express delivery volume</code> saw a significant increase, rising from 51 billion pieces in 2018 to 83 billion pieces in 2020. Similarly, the rural express delivery volume also experienced growth, increasing from 12 billion pieces in 2018 to 30 billion pieces in 2020.</p>
<p>These trends suggest a growing reliance on e-commerce and online shopping across China, particularly in rural areas. The expansion of logistics infrastructure and improved accessibility to online services likely contributed to this rise. Moreover, the increasing popularity of online platforms may have encouraged more people to purchase goods remotely, further driving up the demand for express delivery services.</p>
<p>In summary, the chart demonstrates a clear upward trajectory in both total and rural express delivery volumes in China from 2018 to 2020, reflecting broader shifts towards digital commerce and enhanced connectivity within the country.</p>

<p>The bar chart illustrates the changes in mobile-phone subscription numbers from 2000 to 2008, comparing the subscription numbers of developing countries and developed countries. Over the approximately one-decade period(Over an eight-year period), the subscription number of developing countries saw a significant increase, rising from about 0.5 billion in 2000 to 4 billion in 2008. Similarly, the subscription number of developed countries also grew, but it was much smaller, increasing from about 0.5 billion in 2000 to 1 billion in 2008.</p>
<p>We may attribute this phenomenon to the following aspects.(This results from a combination of factors).To begin with,</p>
<p>Based on the above analysis, clearly, the growth trends of mobile-phone subscription indicated by the chart are bound to continue in the forthcoming future.</p>

<p>The <code>line graph</code> presents the <code>health literacy rate</code> of <code>Chinese residents</code> from 2012 to 2021. In about a decade, there has been a steady increase in the percentage of <code>individuals</code> with <code>adequate health knowledge and skills</code>. Starting at 8.80% in 2012, the rate climbed gradually each year, reaching 25.40% by 2021. This upward trajectory suggests a positive trend in <code>public health awareness and education efforts across the country during</code> this period.</p>
<p>We can&#x2F;may attribute this phenomenon to the following aspects.(Several factors may account for these&#x2F;this change).To begin with, government implementation of more effective [relevant policies] has contributed to the rise in [specific indicator].What’s more,greater availability of [type of information] through [specific channels such as digital media, the internet, etc.] has made it easier for people to obtain relevant information. Additionally,continuous efforts by government and social organizations to conduct [specific activities such as health education, disease prevention, etc.] have improved public awareness and skills.</p>
<p>This trend highlights the importance of continued investment in <code>specific areas such as health education and public health</code> to maintain and accelerate progress in these fields. To sum up, we can predict that this trend will continue in  the future. </p>

<p>The bar chart shows the changes in the Air Quality Index (AQI) in four big Chinese cities—Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen—from 2010 to 2020. This chart helps us understand how the air quality has changed in these cities over the years.</p>
<p>In Beijing, the AQI went down a lot, from 120 in 2010 to 80 in 2020. This big drop means the air quality got much better, probably because of strong environmental rules and actions taken by the government. Shanghai also saw a similar change, with its AQI going down from 110 to 75, showing that the city is working hard to reduce pollution.On the other hand, Guangzhou’s AQI stayed almost the same, between 90 and 100. This means the air quality in Guangzhou didn’t change much, even though the city is trying to keep it steady. In Shenzhen, the AQI went up a little, from 70 to 85. This small increase is worrying and shows that the air quality is getting worse, which needs attention.</p>
<p>Overall, the chart tells us that Beijing and Shanghai have done a good job in improving air quality, thanks to their strong environmental policies. However, Guangzhou’s air quality didn’t change much, and Shenzhen’s got worse. These results show that different cities need different plans to deal with pollution and keep the environment clean.</p>
